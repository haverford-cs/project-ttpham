# Stock Market Prediction Using Daily News
## Tessa Pham

## Lab Notebook

12/10/2019 (2 hours)
* examined data format
* found tools in pandas and sklearn for loading and processing data
* implemented util functions for processing data into training and test sets

12/11/2019 (2 hours)
* read about bag-of-words model
* played around with DataFrame
* implemented bag-of-words with CountVectorizer

12/12/2019 (1 hour)
* ran Logistic Regression
* produced confusion matrix using code from lab
* 42% accuracy only!
* selecting more ML algos to experiment with

12/13/2019 (1 hour)
* produced confusion matrix with pandas
* exploring NLP methods to get better predictions with text data

12/15/2019 (1 hour)
* implemented KNN and SVM
* read about TFIDF

12/17/2019 (8-10 hours)
* implemented Naive Bayes and Random Forest
* added pipeline with TFIDF for each algo
* tried not counting stop words => worse performance
* GridSearchCV to tune parameters for each of 5 classifiers
* A LOT of test runs for tuned parameters and fixing stuff (most time-consuming!)
* calculated AUC scores
* added stemming to vectorizer to reduce # features
* plotted ROC curves for each classifier against random guessing
* exploring bigram models

12/18/2019:

(4 hours)
* implemented bag-of-bigrams model
* generated ROC curve plots for bigram model with different classifiers
* tried bigram + TFIDF => worse performance
* calculated coefficients for words, selecting top words with highest pos/neg correlations with '1' label
* worked on presentation

(5 hours)
* refactored code for 2 separate models
* put back calculations for coeffs and TFIDF values for both models
* exported coeffs and TFIDF values (i.e., word importances) to Excel and CSV files
* final reruns, performance records, and plot figures for all model + classifier pairs
* updated README

## Navigate the Repository
* `run_unigram.py`: runs 5 classifiers with the bag-of-words + TFIDF model.
* `run_bigram.py`: runs 5 classifiers with the bag-of-bigrams model.
ROC curve plots will be recreated from each run, thus may be different from the results recorded in the next section (e.g., for Random Forest).
* `stocknews`: contains labeled data.
* `figs`: contains ROC curve plot figures.
* `idf`: contains TFIDF values for all words and bigrams in the vocabulary of the given text data. A number of most and least important words are exported into separate files for ease of reference.
* `coeffs`: contains coefficients for all words and bigrams in the vocabulary of the given text data. 30 words with highest/lowest correlations with the '1' label are provided in separate files for the unigram model, and 300 words for the bigram model.
